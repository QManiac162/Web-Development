        <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
        <p>This text might not be the introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one, it might be split up into several sub-headings.</p>

        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
        <p>Many long articles have sub-headings to help you to follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).</p>

        <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
        <p>Here you can see another sub-heading</p>
        <p lang="en-us">paragraph in english</p>
        <p lang="fr">paragraphe en franca</p>
