        <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
        <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from the earth crust as well as materials released from the organisms. The most important components of the sea water that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as their influence on the marine life.</p>
